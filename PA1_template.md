```r

con <- unz(".\\activity.zip", filename = "activity.csv")
#Read the activity data from the zipped file into the dataframe activity
activity <- read.csv(con,

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
